- 👋 Hi, I’m @pashaamiriali
- 👀 I’m interested in How the brain works and how to work with it. (it includes a little 
    bit of python for the magical stuff and a bit of dart, java, c#, php, html, css... to showcase the magic!).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning statistics in python (so that I can view things from the top).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that has to do with human cognition (learning stuff mostly).
- 📫 How to reach me pashaamiriali@gmail.com (you can ask questions too hopefully I can help).
